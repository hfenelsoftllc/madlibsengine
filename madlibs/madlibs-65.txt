HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER
 
Many STICKY photographers make big money
photographing WALNUTSs and beautiful SANDWICHs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in PANTHER advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a ARMY camera. You also need an
ABUNDANT meter and filters and a special close-up
SUN. Then you either hire professional SANDWICHs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JELLYFISHs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very BEAUTIFULLY for at
least 42 years.
