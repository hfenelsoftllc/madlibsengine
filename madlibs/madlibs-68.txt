HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER
 
Many CHUBBY photographers make big money
photographing VIOLINs and beautiful SANDWICHs. They sell
the prints to STICKY magazines or to agencies who use
them in CAT advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a MILK camera. You also need an
THUNDERING meter and filters and a special close-up
SUN. Then you either hire professional SANDWICHs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary ARMYs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least 101 years.
