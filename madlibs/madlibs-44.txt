HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER
 
Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing ARMYs and beautiful VIOLINs. They sell
the prints to THUNDERING magazines or to agencies who use
them in SUN advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a SANDWICH camera. You also need an
BITTER meter and filters and a special close-up
MILK. Then you either hire professional VIOLINs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary CATs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very TRUTHFULLY for at
least 42 years.
