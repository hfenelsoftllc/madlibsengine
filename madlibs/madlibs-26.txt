HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER
 
Many ABUNDANT photographers make big money
photographing JIGSAWs and beautiful ZEUSs. They sell
the prints to STICKY magazines or to agencies who use
them in BANANA advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a WALNUTS camera. You also need an
CHUBBY meter and filters and a special close-up
SUN. Then you either hire professional ZEUSs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary JELLYFISHs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least 27 years.
