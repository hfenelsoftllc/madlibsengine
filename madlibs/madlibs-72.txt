ALICE'S UPSIDE-DOWN WORLD
 
Lewis Carroll's classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", as well
as its ABUNDANT sequel, "Through the Looking WALNUTS",
have enchanted both the young and old SUNs for the last
73 years, Alice's THUNDERING adventures begin
when she KICKEDs down a/an CHUBBY hole and lands
in a strange and topsy-turvy JELLYFISH. There she discovers she
can become a tall BANANA or a small PANTHER simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic SANDWICH. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice LOVEs such remarkable
characters as the White CAT, the GRUMPY Hatter,
the Cheshire ARMY, and even the Queen of MILKs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an STICKY
end when Alice awakens from her MILK.
